						to place a significant emphasis on the Phantom's mask, which looms over the opera stage
						represented by the red theatre curtains. This directs the viewer's gaze to the title of the
						book, set in a powerful gothic typeface. The mask on my cover was actually the face from a Greek
						statue, which are typically carved with such symmetrical beauty.</b>

					<h6>HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF THE WITCH POSTER RE-DESIGN</h6>
					<b>For my Design Appreciation class, I was tasked with recreating something for a modern audience.
						Being a massive fan of the horror genre, I decided to design a poster for my favorite Halloween
						movie, "Halloween III: Season of the Witch". My concept was to create a poster that would align
						with the Blumhouse Halloween movies, which were current at the time of designing this poster.
						Their posters were very minimal, showcasing just Michael Myers' mask in high detail and the
						title. Using Adobe Photoshop, I took photographs of the three masks featured in Halloween 3 and
						arranged them in an interesting way that guides the eye through each mask and into the film's
						title. An additional layer of scan lines was applied to the masks because the television played
						a pivotal role in the film.</b>

						Picture Show, I decided to create a poster promoting its run in Rome, Italy. Italy is not
						generally associated with hosting shows that are as raunchy and risqué as Rocky Horror; rather,
						it is renowned for its culture, religion, and arts. Taking this into consideration, I developed
						the concept of incorporating the Statue of David, but defacing it with Frank N Furter's makeup
						and wardrobe. Designed in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. </b>

						movie filmed in Nova Scotia. I sketched several versions of the killer miner character, ranging
						from realistic to pointillism styles, which I then digitally rendered using Adobe Illustrator to
						serve as focal points for the printed material. I opted for a color palette of pink, red, and
						white to not only symbolize Valentine's Day but also evoke the Canadian spirit. Additionally,
						the postcard features a 3D effect, inspired by the movie's remake, which was released in 3D.</b>

						witnessing something we shouldn't, as if the actual comics are merely a facade for what truly
						unfolds in Garfield. Hence, I incorporated a background of inverted newspaper colors,
						reminiscent of scenes in movies and shows where characters sift through old archives of
						newspapers on microfilm readers.</b>
